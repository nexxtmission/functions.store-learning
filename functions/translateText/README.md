### How this function works

Use this function to translate strings written to a Cloud Firestore collection.

This function listens for the changes made to a Cloud Firestore collection. When a string is added to a specified field in any document within that the collection, this function:

- Translates the string into the target language(s); the source language of the string is automatically detected.
- Adds the translation(s) of the string to a separate field in the same document.

Target languages must use ISO-639-1 codes. You can find a list of valid languages and their corresponding codes in [Cloud Translation API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).

The translations will also be updated when the original non-translated field in the document is modified.

> **Note** To translate multiple collections you must install the function several times
